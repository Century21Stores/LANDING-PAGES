<h1>Century 21 Stores Accessibility Statement (Draft)</h1>


    <p>Century 21 Stores is guided by our mission to revamp the traditional retail model, allowing shoppers to access designer brands at amazing prices. Our employees reflect our core values of “Respect, Teamwork, Honesty, Communicate, Grow, Positivity and Amaze.” This backdrop informs our accessibility statement.</p>

    <p>Century 21 Stores is committed to digital accessibility, and to conforming to the <a href="https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/web-content-accessibility-guidelines-wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> 2.1, Level AA and complying with the Department of Justice's <a href="https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/ada-guidelines-compliance/" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> Standards for Accessible Design, and other applicable regulations.</p>

    <p>To accomplish this, we have partnered with eSSENTIAL Accessibility to administer our accessibility program and oversee its governance. Their accessibility program evaluates and audits our digital products on an ongoing basis in accordance with best practices and is supported by a diverse team of accessibility professionals, including users of assistive technologies. The platform, moreover, goes beyond minimum compliance requirements by making an <a href="https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/century-21-department-stores/?utm_source=c21storeshomepage&utm_medium=iconlarge&utm_term=eachannelpage&utm_content=header&utm_campaign=c21stores" target="_blank">assistive CX technology application</a> available to customers who have trouble typing, gesturing, moving a mouse, or reading. The application is free to download and it incorporates tools such as mouse and keyboard replacements, voice recognition, speech enablement, hands-free/touch-free navigation, and more.</p>
