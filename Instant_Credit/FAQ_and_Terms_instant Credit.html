  <div class="jm-titleToggleQ">
  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A C21STATUS RED LOYALTY GUEST VS. A C21STATUS CREDIT CARD GUEST?
  </div>
  <div class="jm-toggleAnswer">
  <p>C21STATUS Red Loyalty guests earn 1 point per $1 spent on qualifying merchandise. C21STATUS Credit Card guests earn points and rewards quicker when they are approved and use the C21STATUS Credit Card.</p>
  <p>Premier credit card holders earn 2 points per $1 spent on qualifying merchandise when they use their C21STATUS Credit Card while Elite credit card holders earn 4 points per $1 spent on qualifying merchandise when they use their C21STATUS Credit Card. Spend $1,500 per year to qualify as an Elite cardholder. In addition, credit card holders have special benefits, including priority checkout in stores, special offers and events, and free shipping on online orders over $50.</p>
  <p>Premier and Elite credit card guests can still earn 1 point per $1 spent if they do not pay with the C21STATUS Credit Card so long as they provide the email address associated with their C21STATUS Rewards account in-store or log in to their account online.</p>

<div class="jm-TERMS-content">

  
  <p>        <b>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY. THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IN THE C21STATUS REWARDS PROGRAM.
POINTS ACCRUED UNDER THIS PROGRAM EXPIRE ON A ROLLING 12-MONTH BASIS FROM THE DATE THEY ARE EARNED. BEFORE THEIR EXPIRATION, YOU MAY REDEEM POINTS FOR CENTURY 21 DEPARTMENT STORES REWARD DOLLARS VALID AT CENTURY 21 DEPARTMENT STORES AND C21STORES.COM. REWARD DOLLARS ARE ISSUED FOR AWARD PURPOSES AND EXPIRE 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE THEY ARE ISSUED. YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE REWARD DOLLARS. </b>
<p>
<b>THIS C21STATUS REWARDS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED BY CENTURY 21 DEPARTMENT STORES WHICH IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM OPERATION. CENTURY 21 DEPARTMENT STORES MAY CHANGE THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME.</b>
The C21STATUS Program is designed to reward frequent guests of Century 21 Department Stores with C21STATUS Points that can be redeemed for Rewards Dollars to use toward future purchases. C21STATUS Points are based on guest purchase activity within a rolling 12-month period based on program enrollment and first date of usage as a C21STATUS member. 
</p>
<b>Earning Points.</b> You will earn Points for Net New Purchases. For credit card accounts, your Account must be in Good Standing. You will earn:
2 Points for each $1.00 of Net New Purchases on the C21STATUS Premier Credit Card.
4 Points for each $1.00 of Net New Purchases on the C21STATUS Elite Credit Card<sup>1</sup>.
1 Point for each $1.00 of Net New Purchases made on any other form of tender<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>Qualifying points on purchases with your C21STATUS account are updated the 1st of every month and may be viewed at <a href="/login">www.c21stores.com/login</a>.</p>
  
  <p>“Net New Purchases” means purchases of goods and/or services made minus any returns, refunds or credit adjustments, rounded to the nearest dollar. Points awarded for purchases that are returned or refunded or otherwise adjusted will be deducted from your Point total. Such deductions may result in a negative Points balance, in which case, any Points you earn will be applied to reduce that balance and you will not be able to redeem Points until you again have a positive balance.
C21STATUS Points are not earned on: purchase of Gift cards, sales tax, shipping/handling fees, or unauthorized or fraudulent charges. 
For every 500 points earned guests will earn $10 in C21STATUS Reward Dollars. C21STATUS Points will not be earned if you use a merchandise credit to complete a purchase or on the portion of a purchase made with C21STATUS Reward Dollars. Returns on purchases will be deducted from any earned C21STATUS Reward Dollars.
We may from time to time make special offers for you to earn additional Points on specific purchases. The terms and conditions for such special offers (such as which purchases qualify and the number of additional Points you may earn) will be disclosed at the time of offer. Please check those terms and conditions carefully, as there may be important conditions or limitations (such as blackout periods, point limitations or exclusions). Availability of any special offer is subject to change without notice.
Some or all of such special offers to accumulate additional Points may require you to register your Account in order to be eligible for the offer. For special offers requiring registration, the offer will provide you with information on how to register, as well as the time period in which you must register in order to be eligible for the offer.  You must register within the required time period and prior to making a qualifying purchase in order to receive the additional Points on such purchase. You must not have opted-out of receiving marketing mail from Century 21 Department Store as of the date we send our emails.

  <p><b>Program Activity and Customer Service.</b> You can view your Program activity within the My Account page after logging in at <a href="/login">www.c21stores.com/login</a>, which will show the number of unused and unexpired Points in your Points balance, any unexpired Rewards Dollars available and any redemption activity. You can also call 1-877-350-2121 (TDD/TTY 1-855-580-2121) for such information and to find out whether you earned Points from a particular transaction.</p>

        <p><b>Points Disputes</b>. If you believe that a purchase made on your Account should have resulted in the addition of Points to your earned Points balance, and such Points are not reflected in the earned Points balance within forty-five (45) days of the date on which the purchase posted to your Account (“Points Dispute”), notify us immediately. We will use reasonable efforts to investigate your Points Dispute so long as you notify us of such dispute within ninety (90) days of the posting date of such purchase. If you do not notify us within such ninety (90)-day period, you will have waived your right to make a Points Dispute with respect to that purchase. In order for us to undertake an investigation of your Points Dispute, we may require you to provide written confirmation of the dispute. If we do not receive the requested written confirmation at the address and within the time requested by us, we may in our sole discretion determine not to investigate your Points Dispute. Upon completion of our investigation of your Points Dispute, we will have no further responsibilities should you later reassert the same Points Dispute.
You may cancel your participation in the Program at any time by calling us at 1-877-350-2121 (TDD/TTY 1-855-580-2121).  If you cancel your participation in the Program, you will no longer earn Points and, as previously noted, you will forfeit your unused and unexpired Points.</p>

        <p><b>Not Transferable</b>. Points are not your property and are not transferable to anyone by operation of law or otherwise. Points may not be transferred between C21STATUS Rewards Program accounts, may not be transferred upon death or as part of any domestic relations legal proceedings, and may not be brokered, bartered, sold or transferred in any way. Any attempted transaction of such sort will automatically be void. Anyone selling, purchasing, brokering, bartering, transferring, or altering Points, either wholly or partially, shall be liable for payment of the applicable full retail price of any Reward Certificates obtained with them, as well as all damages, including, but not limited to consequential damages, transaction costs, and litigation costs (including attorney’s fees and costs at trial and on appeal and in any bankruptcy proceeding). Any brokered, bartered, altered, sold, or purchased Points shall likewise be void and may be deducted from your Points balance. Any violation of these provisions will result in termination of your eligibility to participate in the Program and forfeiture of unused Points.</p>

         <p><b>Taxes.</b> You are solely liable for any applicable federal, state or local income, sales, use, or other taxes arising out of the accrual or use of Points. Consult your tax advisor concerning any tax consequences that may arise from your participation in the Program. </p>
