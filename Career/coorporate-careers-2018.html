    <h2>CORPORATE CAREERS <br/>AT CENTURY</h2>
    <p>From buying incredible fashion to merchandising and marketing it, a passion for Century 21 Storess amazing deals and amazing, unique culture shines through—a passion that we hope you share.</p>

    <p>We want you to wake up excited to go to the office. Employees at Century 21 say that working here feels like being with family. That’s why they love coming to work every day—and why you will, too. In fact, the founding Gindi family still runs the day-to-day operations of our privately-owned company, taking great personal pride in making it a continued success. The sons of the original owners, Al and Sonny Gindi, lead the corporate team along with an executive committee made up of chief officers with decades of experience from across the retail industry. You will be inspired by how hands-on higher management is and how you can take an active role in shaping the company’s future—and your own.</p>

    <p>You’ll find our New York corporate offices located in Downtown Manhattan, in the heart of our flagship store at 22 Cortlandt Street. That is where our merchant team sits, with well-connected buyers constantly on the hunt for the latest fashion finds from around the globe for our customers. These designer brands at amazing prices have a wow factor that sets us apart from the off-price retail competition. It’s why you will find working here as one-of-a-kind an experience as our one-of-a-kind merchandise.</p>

<article id='jm-coorporate-quote'>
    <p>“In my over 30 years of experience here, the company has evolved and grown tenfold and we’ve all been part of that growth—it’s a great feeling. What’s also great is that it’s a family-run business and the owners are totally accessible, whereas in other corporations you don’t feel that.”</p>
